# FractionalCalculus.jl

Hello thereðŸ‘‹!

FractionalCalculus.jl is a Julia package aiming at providing support for computing fractional derivative and fractional integral.

```@contents
Pages = ["index.md"]
```

!!! tip "Star Us"
	If you think **FractionalCalculus.jl** is useful and powerful, please [star us in GitHub](httpd://github.com/SciFracX/FractionalCalculus.jl), it means a lot to us!

## Installation

To install FractionalCalculus, please open Julia REPL and press`]` key to use package mode and then type the following command:

```julia-repl
pkg> add FractionalCalculus
```

Or if you want to experience the latest version of FractionalCalculus.jl:

```julia-repl
pkg> add FractionalCalculus#master
```

## Features

* Feature-Rich. FractionalCalculus now has algorithms for **Caputo fractional derivative**, **Grunwald-Letnikov fractional derivative** and **Riemann-Liouville fractional integral** support, more algorithms are planned to support to enrich the package ecosystem.

* Easy to Use. FractionalCalculus.jl is quite easy to use, with only a few API but equiped a lot algorithms.

!!! tip "Fractional Differential Equations"
	Want to solve fractional differential equations with performant and effcient algorithms? Please see [FractionalDiffEq.jl](https://github.com/SciFracX/FractionalDiffEq.jl)

```

## Plans

- Symbolic differentiation and integration

- Add more visualization of how the fraction derivative and integral are changing based on Makie or Javis or Manim
